## Vue List

1. Use the `v-for` directive to make an `<li>` tag for every item in the fruits array. Reference the documentation for help: <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/>

2. After two seconds, add three more items to the fruits array. If everything is working correctly, the DOM should automatically show these new fruits.

3. **BONUS:** Use the `v-if` directive to add an `<em>` tag next to your favorite fruit. The final output should look like this:

  * banana
  * apple _-- my favorite!_
  * orange
  * etc.
